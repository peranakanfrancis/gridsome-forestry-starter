### What our customer says about it

> _I've tried the fish curry, and it also easy to cook, I always thought that cook a bowl of curry need a lot of ingredients and works but now I'm wrong as with this convenient packet, I can cook whenever I wasn't as long as I get a fresh fish from supermarket and few more ingredient, then I can make my own curry to eat. The taste suitable for me which my mom also said my cooking skill is improved :). You may try it sometimes and amazed your friends and family._
