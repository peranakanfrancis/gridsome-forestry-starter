### What our customers say about this

> _"In Germany it is very cold right now, we have had a lot of snow, about half a meter and temperature to -20 degrees. Now, your curry helped to get a little warm inside, and it tastes really good. My wife created a special recipe, with some coconut milk, and chicken meat; absolutely delicious."_ - **Dieter Frieauff, Germany**
