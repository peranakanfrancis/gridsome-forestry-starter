> _"Before that, I never eat tom yum coz I think it is too spicy until one day my friend forced me to try and I remembered it was in your father's restaurant. After that, I tried a lot of tom yum in different place but I'm still prefer yours. Thank god that I can buy your tom yum paste and make myself at home now. It is recommend to everyone else who likes to eat the fantastic taste of Thailand tom yum."_ - Zeon Wong, Penang
