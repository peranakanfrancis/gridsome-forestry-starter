**_*Tip 1_:**

Shrimp shells, tails, and even the heads are packed with delicious, briny flavour. Save them and make a quick stock to use in your shrimp recipe. It just takes a few minutes of stove time to extract the yummy flavours. If you have shrimp heads, give those a quick rinse under cold water first. Then place the heads, shells, and tails in a saucepan with enough cold water to just cover the shells. Simmer the whole thing uncovered for 15 minutes or until the water takes on a light orange-ish stock color, then strain all the shells out. Use the stock in this recipe in place of water for an extra boost of flavour.

**_*Tip 2_:**

Though we've put yellow noodles into this Penang Chilli Prawn Noodle Recipe, you're free to use any type of noodle you like. I even use pasta sometimes! As for the fried shallot, you can fry a big portion at one go, then seal them in a jar for future use.
