The first thing you'll notice about the mixed vegetable curry recipe is that it offers a lot of bright colours, and that's because the vegetables involved are so colourful! We've got a good mix of vegetables: pepper/capsicum, eggplant, long bean, okra and mushroom. This is a great recipe for a vegetarian curry lover, as the [Khimyan Vegetarian Curry Paste](https://khimyancurry.com/projects/buy-vegetarian-curry-paste/) is made with vegetarians in mind - there is no garlic and onion in the paste.

When it comes to the carbs for this curry, I love serving it with either rice or yellow noodle. They absorb the flavour well and with the curry, make a truly satisfying meal. Maybe you'll have the perfect to enjoy your version of the mixed vegetable curry recipe.

**P/s**: If you want something texture, feel free to to add the vegetarian meat substitute to the recipe. I suggest using vegetarian fish fillet - you can deep-fry the fish fillet in a saucepan before adding it into the curry. It will add some extra crunch to the curry.
