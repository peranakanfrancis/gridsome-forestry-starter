In today's fast-paced world, a lot of us just don't have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen, especially on hectic weekdays. But you know what? Maybe we don't have to. Maybe we can make great chicken curry a lot faster than my mom used to make. [Khimyan Curry Chicken Paste](https://khimyancurry.com/projects/sunk/) cuts down several hours' of work down to just 30 minutes. Yes. 30 minutes is all you need before you're enjoying a hearty and satisfying chicken curry.

How does this chicken curry taste? Well, according to my native Indian friends, our chicken curry recipe has a strong Southern Indian flavour to it, with some subtle mixture of Malay and Chinese influence in the ingredients. The spicy taste of this fantastic chicken curry is something you're not going to find elsewhere - it's an authentic Malaysian curry. 

For me, the interesting part of this curry chicken recipe is that, even though you're using our curry paste, you can play around with the recipe so that it suits your taste or craving. If you like it Indian-style, just follow the recipe provided. If you're after a milder Chinese curry style, you can add a bit more coconut milk; it will give the curry a sweet taste, as well as cutting down on the spiciness a tad. You can call it _Coconut Chicken Curry._ If you like the curry thick and flavorful, you can reduce the quantity of water used to make the curry more concentrated. If you're the health-conscious type, use low-fat milk instead of coconut milk. It's your chicken curry and it's all about giving you options so you can make it suit your taste.

When it comes to enjoying chicken curry, you can do it in a variety of ways. The Chinese love to eat it with rice and noodles. I like to use it as a spicy pasta sauce (you can try that!) The Indians love to eat it with Roti Canai, a savoury flatbread - this is a very popular way to eat chicken curry in Malaysia and Singapore. There is also a Malay snack known as a 'curry puff', a very popular afternoon snack in both Malaysian and Singapore. It's a type of pastry, very similar to the Empanada eaten in Latin America in the sense that it's stuffed, and in the curry puff's case, stuffed with a thick chicken curry. When you bite into the crispy pastry, the spicy chicken curry inside slowly drips into your mouth....are you drooling yet?
