Sambal Kangkung is a popular and beloved traditional Malaysian sambal recipe that's stood the test of time. You find Malaysian eating at any occasion and you can find it at any restaurant serving Malaysian food.

_What is sambal?_

Sambal is a thick spicy sauce which has belacan in it; belancan is toasted shrimp paste. The other main ingredients in sambal include turmeric, shallot, chilli, onion, calamansi lime (known locally as limau kasturi) and salt and sugar. It is a unique sauce that plays an integral role in many Malay dishes. Sambal sauce can be used to cook vegetables, poultry and seafood. Some cooks love to to add it to fried noodles or fried rice. By using the thick spicy paste, they can really imbue the noodles or rice with a strong shrimpy flavour, not to mention a fiery kick that will be sure to whet your appetite. Sambal recipes are often times a well-kept family secret (just like mine).

Kangkung (also known as water spinach) has the great taste and texture to make it the perfect vegetable to be cooked with sambal. It is a very common dish that is served in most Malaysian families. [Khimyan Sambal Tumis Sauce](https://khimyancurry.com/projects/buy-sambal-tumis-sauce/) is slightly milder than the usual Malaysian sambal sauce, so if you enjoy your meals the hot and spicy way, you can add 2 or 3 chilies to this recipe.
