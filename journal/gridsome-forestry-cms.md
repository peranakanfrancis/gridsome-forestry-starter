The secret in making a really good bowl of Penang Hokkien Mee (or Penang Prawn Noodle) is in the preparation of the ingredients used to make the soup base. To be considered a lip-smacking, taste-bud satisfying bowl of Penang Hokkien Mee, you've got to have that delicious prawn-taste infused into the soup, such that it's still lingering in your mouth even after you've slurped the very last drop of soup.

And now, we offer you the [Khimyan Penang Hokkien Mee Paste](https://khimyancurry.com/projects/chelsea-landmark/), and the results? Stunning! to say the least. We've received many positive feedback, especially those from Australia, Indonesia and Singapore, who've visited Penang and enjoyed the hawkers' Penang Hokkien Mee here. And their verdict after making their own with our paste? Almost as perfect as the original version! Many have said it's the next best thing to actually going down to Penang and enjoying one at the hawker stalls.

Our secret? No secret, really: it's all in the ingredients. We use real shrimp and top quality raw ingredients in our curry pastes - you can't get that great taste with the artificial stuff. And that's our "secret" when it comes to standing out from the rest. Some of the members in our foodie community like to pre-cook the shrimp heads in a pot of water, then add the paste into the broth. That's a really smart thing to do, if you have the time for it. For those who are in need of some fast Penang Hokkien Mee action, our paste is the only ingredient you'll need to make the soup. When I am craving for a spicier alternative to instant noodles, I'll just make a soup base using our paste, then add plain noodles to it - very little time needed and simply delicious.

### **Direction:**

1. Bring 1300ml water to boil, then pour 1 packet of [Khimyan Penang Hokkien Mee Paste](https://khimyancurry.com/projects/chelsea-landmark/) and stir for 2 minutes.
2. Blanch the yellow noodle, rice vermicelli, bean sprout, and kangkung in a separate pot.

**_*Tip 1_:**

Shrimp shells, tails, and even the heads are packed with delicious, briny flavour. Save them and make a quick stock to use in your shrimp recipe. It just takes a few minutes of stove time to extract the yummy flavours. If you have shrimp heads, give those a quick rinse under cold water first. Then place the heads, shells, and tails in a saucepan with enough cold water to just cover the shells. Simmer the whole thing uncovered for 15 minutes or until the water takes on a light orange-ish stock color, then strain all the shells out. Use the stock in this recipe in place of water for an extra boost of flavour.

**_*Tip 2_:**

Though we've put yellow noodles into this Penang Hokkien Noodle Recipe, you're free to use any type of noodle you like. I even use pasta sometimes! As for the fried shallot, you can fry a big portion at one go, then seal them in a jar for future use.
