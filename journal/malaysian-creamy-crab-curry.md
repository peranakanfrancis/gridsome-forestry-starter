I have a hate-love relationship toward crab - I love it's tender and juicy meat but at the same time I extremely hate to spend so much time just to crack it open. But If you are a person into crabs a lot, then you ought to try this Malaysian (and Singaporean too) most favourite Curry Crab recipe. 

Get your fishmonger to prepare the crabs, discard the hard shell and reserve the tomalley. While this dish is traditionally prepared with green mud crab in Malaysia, we used a 5kg Dungeness crab. If you canâ€™t find green mud crab or Dungeness crab in your area, you can always use another crab like the stone crab or blue crab. 

The coconut milk give quite a riches to this dish but it blends so well with the crabs and rest of the ingredients in [Khimyan Fish & Prawn Curry Paste](https://khimyancurry.com/projects/fish-curry-paste/) such as curry leaves, curry powder, garlic, ginger, star anise, cinnamon, green chilies, and chili powder. The result? A curry crab full of flavour bomb that loved by a lot of foodie.
