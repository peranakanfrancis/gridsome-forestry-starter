A big thank you goes to my Aunt who came up with this mouth-watering steamed fish with tom yum and who is kind enough to share it with family and friends (and of course, me!). Her story goes like this: She was preparing dinner in the kitchen one day when she discovered some leftover [Khimyan Thai Tom Yum Sauce](https://khimyancurry.com/projects/3d-graff/) in the refrigerator. She also had a big white fish in the refrigerator, so naturally, her quick mind though: why not combine the two? And that's how she came up with the idea to steam the fish with the Tom Yum paste. She had never cooked such a dish before, but due to her cooking skills, she came up with a recipe that does all the ingredients proud.

And as you'd probably expect, the dish came out well. Very well, in fact. The spicy, sour taste and aroma on the fresh white steam fish made drove her hungry family wild as soon as it was placed on the table. Let's just say that there were no leftovers! My Aunt then proceeded to share her recipe with her sisters, friends and neighbours. They were very excited and enthusiastic about the recipe because it was easy and quick. In fact, it took less than 25 minutes to prepare!

And when it came to the preparation, all you needed to do was make sure you descale and clean the fish properly, then you spread some [Khimyan Thai Tom Yum Sauce](https://khimyancurry.com/projects/3d-graff/) on the fish, garnish it with some vegetables and then proceed to steam it. And just like that, you've got a delicious and incredibly taste steam fish ready for you in just a few minutes. enjoy this dish with friends and family - they'll thank you for it!
