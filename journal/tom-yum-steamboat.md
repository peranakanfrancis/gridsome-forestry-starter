We love throwing dinner parties at home for family and friends - the joy of eating something prepared at home and the ease of lounging at a familiar place cannot be compared to commercial restaurants with closing hours and little privacy. So we came up with an idea of throwing a simple steamboat party menu in less than 30 minutes.

So, how do we serve up this Steamboat Soup (or Hot Pot)? First, you'll have to set up a hot pot, using [Khimyan Thai Tom Yam Sauce](https://khimyancurry.com/projects/3d-graff/) as the base soup. Just throw in fresh seafood (especially those with shells) and vegetables and that's it. If you have shrimp heads, give those a quick rinse under cold water first. Then place the heads, shells, and tails in a saucepan with enough cold water to just cover the shells. Simmer the whole thing uncovered for 15 minutes or until the water takes on a light orange-ish stock colour, then strain all the shells out. Use the stock in this recipe in place of water for an extra boost of flavour. Why? It's because shrimp shells, tails, and even the heads are packed with delicious, briny flavour. Save them and make a quick stock, It just takes a few minutes of stove time to extract the yummy flavours.

If you are living in a country where four seasons apply, you'll want to check out this Tom Yum Steamboat Soup and once you taste it we guarantee you'll want to have it over and over again! And if you've ever enjoyed an Asian hot-pot meal, you know what I mean when I say "Anything goes!" A hot-pot in the centre of the table, fresh food all around the hot-pot, ready to be dipped into the soup for cooking, and of course, your family or friends all around you - a gourmet's dream come true and a splendid dinner during those cold winter days.
