This Tom Yum fried noodle recipe makes for a quick, easy and totally satisfying meal. Fried noodle is a popular and very common dish in Asia, with each country in the region having so many variants of it. A seafood style fried noodle dish might feature thin, rice vermicelli with calamari and shrimp while a spicier fried noodle dish might feature see-through "glass noodle" with a large dose of chili and a hint of sourness to it - there are as many variations as there are noodles and ingredients!

Our recipe is a fusion between Malaysian and Thai cuisine - The hot and sour [Khimyan Tom Yum Sauce](https://khimyancurry.com/projects/3d-graff/) is used to cook and flavored with Malaysian-style fried noodles. The taste is a balance of hot and sour flavors that will leave you wanting more! Like all our other curry recipes, you're free to change or add different ingredients as you like.

As they say in French: _Bon Appetit!_
