![](/uploads/fish-prawn-curry-paste.png)This Fish Head Curry recipe has a lot of South Indian flavour - it's a little bit salty and starchy, and the soup has got a lot of flavour going for it. It's got just the right blend of spices for an all-authentic Malaysian-style fish head curry. This is one of the most sought-after dishes by Malaysian curry lovers. And the best part, you can cook it in a very easy and quick way at home with Khimyan's Fish & Prawn Curry Paste.

Just like when you're using any Khimyan's brand curry paste in your favourite recipes, it's all about options: you can make changes to the recipe to suit your needs. If you want to sink your teeth into a nice, fresh fish head, all you have to do is add one to the recipe, creating a dish that's perfect for your craving. If fresh squid or shellfish is more your thing, then add them to this recipe. Adding shellfish to this recipe will add a hint of sweetness to the finished dish.

To pull off any good curry fish recipe, you'll need really good fish and that means using the freshest that you've got. Fresh cod makes for the best choice though if you have to depend on frozen fish, then trying getting any white fish with a mild taste to it, ones that only take a few minutes to cook normally. In Malaysia, most people choose to use Ang Sai (Red Lion Fish) for their fish curry.

Here's an interesting tidbit: some of the local old folk love to use leftover fish curry as a dip for their toast, similar to how people enjoy toasted baguette slices with savoury dip. These old folk tell me they enjoy this snack because the flavours in a good fish head curry intensify overnight. If you're interested enough to try this, you can keep some leftover fish head curry overnight in the fridge and reheat it the next day to see the difference in taste!
